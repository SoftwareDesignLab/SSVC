# HTML Processing Scripts

This repository contains three Python scripts for processing HTML documents: 'preprocess_csv', ;compare_trees' and 'simplify_html'. These scripts offer different functionalities for removing noise and simplifying HTML content.

## preprocess_csv

The 'preprocess_csv' script creates a new CSV file to be used by compare_trees. It outputs a new file with up to 5 URLs per domain, chosen by Levenshtein distance. 

### Usage

1. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Update the configuration in the script:
    - Optionally, update the name of the output df with the name of the file you want the processed CSV to be stored for later use. 
    - Optionally, also update the URL limit with the maximum number of URLs you want compared for one specific domain (default is 5). 

3. Run the script using `python preprocess_csv.py`.

## compare_trees

The 'compare_trees' script compares the HTML structure of two webpages and finds identical nodes. It helps identify similarities between different HTML documents. 

### Usage

1. Update the configuration in the script:
    - Update the 'input_csv' variable with the path to the input CSV file with the URLs you want to test (should be the CSV file outputted from preprocess_csv).
    - Optionally, update the 'output_json' variable with the path of the output JSON file where the identical nodes will be stored. 

2. Run the script using the command `python compare_trees.py`.

3. The script will compare the HTML structure of the two webpages and identify the identical nodes. The identical nodes will be stored in the specified output file.

## simplify_html

The 'simplify_html' script simplifies the structure of an HTML document by removing irrelevant elements. It aims to reduce the noise of the HTML code. 

### Usage:

1. Update the configuration in the script:

   - Modify the `INLINE_TAGS`, `REMOVE_TAGS`, `REMOVE_DIVS`, and `KEYWORDS` lists to customize the rules for tag removal and simplification.
   - Update the `url` variable with the URL of the HTML document you want to process.
   - Optionally, update the `json_file` variable with the path to a JSON file containing additional XPath queries for node removal.
   - Optionally, you can also update the 'output_file' variable with the name of the output file you want the simplified HTML to be stored. 

2. Run the script using the command `python simplify_html.py`.
